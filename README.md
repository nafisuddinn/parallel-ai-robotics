# parallel-ai-robotics
Developed VHDL-based control logic for a robot navigating obstacles using AI-driven decisions. Designed parallel
processing pipelines inspired by GPU architectures to compute movement commands in real-time. Implemented a
RAM controller to store sensor data and support AI learning for improved decision making. Verified system
functionality with a custom test bench that simulates real-world scenarios resulting in 4x faster computations.
